<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Hi! I’m a recent MSc graduate in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. I completed my master's thesis *X23D-Intraoperative 3D Spinal Shape Refinement/Reconstruction Based on Sparse Multi-View Fluoroscopy Data* in a collaboration of the [ROCS](https://rocs.balgrist.ch/) group at Balgrist Hospital and the [CVG group](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) at ETH. After completion, which resulted in a publication, I continued developing a prototype at ROCS Balgrist, to showcase the benefits of my research topic in a real world setting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My research and professional interests lie in computer vision and machine learning. Apart from gaining theoretical understanding of these topics, I also enjoy applying them to real-world tasks in a health or natural setting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Before starting my masters study, I finished my undergraduate at the University of Technology Vienna. Just after my undergraduate, I worked at MCP as a Software Developer for 2 years. I focused on creating customised production planning and scheduling solutions for enterprises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
