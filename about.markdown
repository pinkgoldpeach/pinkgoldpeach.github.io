Hi! Iâ€™m a recent MSc graduate in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. I completed my master's thesis *X23D-Intraoperative 3D Spinal Shape Refinement/Reconstruction Based on Sparse Multi-View Fluoroscopy Data* in a collaboration of the [ROCS](https://rocs.balgrist.ch/) group at Balgrist Hospital and the [CVG group](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) at ETH. After completion, which resulted in a publication, I continued developing a prototype at ROCS Balgrist, to showcase the benefits of my research topic in a real world setting.

My research and professional interests lie in computer vision and machine learning. Apart from gaining theoretical understanding of these topics, I also enjoy applying them to real-world tasks in a health or natural setting. 

Before starting my masters study, I finished my undergraduate at the University of Technology Vienna. Just after my undergraduate, I worked at MCP as a Software Developer for 2 years. I focused on creating customised production planning and scheduling solutions for enterprises.
